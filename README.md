# Automatic-MM
RaiQuick was an automated mm on Discord for LTC trades. The bot held LTC, stored in a Wallet (connected to a Litecoin node) where the Bot had access on to send/receive and see Transaction on. After the buyer sent LTC, the seller gave the items to the Buyer. Once the buyer confirmed, they released the payment and the bot sent the LTC to the seller.
