# Automatic-MM
RaiQuick was an automated mm on Discord for LTC trades. The bot held LTC, stored in a Wallet (connected to a Litecoin node) where the Bot had access on to send/receive and see Transaction on. After the buyer sent LTC, the seller gave the items to the Buyer. Once the buyer confirmed, they released the payment and the bot sent the LTC to the seller.
# Automatic-Exchange
SecureSwap-Auto Exchange was a project for PayPal to LTC exchange. The LTC was stored in the same wallet for the Automatic MM (Litecoin node called Litecoin Core). The user ran a command where he could write an Amount to buy via PayPal. It brought him to a Website (sellsn) where he bought the "product". After the website saw I got money (via gmail and looking through paypal emails confirming it is this payment with a note), it confirms that I received the Money to the user. The User had to copy the invoice ID of his Transaction and had to ran another command with his invoice ID and LTC address. The Bot checks if the invoice ID is confirmed (payment is confirmed) and sends the LTC to the address the user provided.
# Raichi Bot
This Bot was my first Bot ever. I tried some random stuff such as creating ur own embed and other stuff like that.
# CodedSmthForSomeone
Someone asked me to Code this Bot which, when I read it correctly, is a Ticket system. I made it for 7$ and wrote some info for the user who bought it.

# About Raichi (creator)
Im raichi_da_goat on Discord. I always wanted to code since coding seems fun and you can make everything out of coding. Thats why I learned python, especially discord.py. I created many things now and I am happy that I can do something which I couldnt do some months ago.
